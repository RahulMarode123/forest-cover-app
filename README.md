# 🌲 Forest Cover Segmentation Project

This is a Streamlit-based web application that detects and analyzes **green (forest) cover** from satellite or aerial images using color segmentation techniques (HSV and BGR). 

It helps visualize vegetation spread and calculates the green area percentage from uploaded images — useful for environmental studies, urban planning, and sustainability tracking.
